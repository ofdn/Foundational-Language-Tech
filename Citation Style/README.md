# OpenSpeaks Citation Style
A Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open source library of styles for automated formatting of citations and bibliographies. The official [repository](https://citationstyles.org/) hosts an extensive list of free CSL citation styles. These citations can be used across several software programs, such as Zotero, to format citations/bibliographies in a particular style. **OpenSpeaks Citation Style** is one such style that is designed explicitly for in-multimedia citation. It was originally created to include a long list of attributions in the credit roll of the 2021 short docufiction film [_Bringing Down a Mountain_](https://theofdn.org/film/bringing-down-a-mountain/), considering the lack of a citation style for in-multimedia attribution.

# Purpose
OpenSpeaks is an in-multimedia citation style, meaning it is optimised, though not restricted, to be helpful in adding citations or attributing within images or video files so that the attribution appears on the screen. The citation style takes into account the need for short and straightforward attributions that would appear for split seconds in places like credit rolls in a video. Despite the many multimedia works created daily, no standards allegedly exist for such purposes. This style would hopefully be helpful for media researchers and media-makers alike.
