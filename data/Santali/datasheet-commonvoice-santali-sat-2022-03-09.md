**1. Purpose and Affordability**

*A set of questions to understand your primary interests to contribute to this project and how affordable it is for you to volunteer.*



***1.1 Why did you start contributing to Common Voice? What you plan to achieve through this project? What motivates you to contribute more?***



My initial goal was to improve access. Santali being a low-resource language does not yet have technologies such as text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT). I thought if I can contribute to improve voice data as it is required to built both STT and TTS, then it would be helpful to develop such technology later. Many monolingual Santali readers with visual disability currently do not have any form of access to information. They have all the right to such access. they should be able to but they do not have any means to rightful access to information.



I also like to volunteer in general and that drove me to contribute to Common Voice. It is addictive – I have felt like competing with myself and setting up goals. Seeing my own progress also is fulfilling.



***1.2 Who are the other contributors? What are their backgrounds? How did they join?***



Currently, myself, Suku Murmu and an anonymous user. I’ve reached to many people. Of all of them, only Suku Murmu, a Santali teacher from West Bengal showed interest. He gave really good feedback to improve the interface translation of the Common Voice web portal. He is also helping with the validation of recorded voice data.



***1.3 Can you share more about your overall contribution to this project? Share different parts of the project where you have contributed.***



I have contributed in sentence collection and proof-reading of collected sentences, localization of interface into Santali, recording of more than 300 sentences and validation of 214 sentences that others have recorded. Santali currently has 32 minutes of total voice data recorded out of which 5:36 minutes of data is validated.



***1.4 How much time do you contribute on a weekly basis?***



Currently I spend about three hours every week. I started in January 2022 and even set goals for myself. But I could not succeed as there was no motivation for a lone contributor. When there are more number of contributors, there is a momentum and a sense of competition. That helps a lot.



***1.5 What would happen if you cannot contribute tomorrow for any reason?***



I think about that a lot. I am in touch with many others via Twitter and other social media platforms. I am reaching out many more and am encouraging others, including my own mother. She has in fact contributed many recordings already. She is currently contributing up to one-two hours every week for Common Voice. I am very confident that there are people to drive even if I become completely inactive tomorrow.



***1.6 Do you train others as well? How much extra time you spend for that?***



I did provide support to Suku when he was starting out. He is a part of an institution in West Bengal. They have showed interest to create a curriculum for digital literacy around Santali. I am preparing a video tutorial and a roadmap to for secondary level education. At the moment computing-related books are not available in Santali. Common Voice is one among the different open source projects that I am recommending to them.



***1.7 Anything you might want to share?***





**2. Hardware and platforms**

*Questions to understand how you contribute, what devices and other platforms you use.*



***2.1 What device do you use to contribute to Common Voice? Did you purchase this yourself or someone else got it for you?***



I just finished my undergraduate course. I am using my phone that my parents got for me. I use it mostly as it gives me more flexibility. I do have a laptop but the microphone is not of good quality.



***2.2 Do you face any issues with your device such as overheating? How did you solve this issue if you ever faced?***



No issues so far while contributing using my phone.



***2.3 What amount of your total monthly data do you spend to contribute?***



About 800 Mb out of 45 Gb on a monthly basis.



**3. Accessibility**

*Questions to understand your accessibility issues and needs while using Common Voice.*



***3.1 Did you face any issue while using the Common Voice platform? What are those issues? What could have been a better way?***



Many contributors use their phones. Sometimes their browser fails to upload after they finish recording 5-10 sentences and it throws an error.  Losing voice contribution because of browser crash is also an issue. Such issues demotivates them. Similarly, while validating, some contributors find no voice at all, long delays when they finally hear a human voice, or only background noise. It is not clear what the real issues issues are. It probably would be better if each sentence could be uploaded immediately after recording instead of uploading a batch of five sentences. People with low internet bandwidth might see their efforts being wasted with the batch uploading option. It would be nice if there can be a backend program to inform the uploader that there contribution includes only background noise and no human voice. Also, flagging the uploader during uploading might also help. Some contributors might not know how to review and might have uploaded such recordings without knowing. Flagging to the users during the time of uploading can save collective time. There can also be a mock round for all new users to record and validate.



Another option can also be allowing the contributor to edit and clean up audio before uploading. Some skilled contributors might want to do it.



***3.2 Is the background colour, font size of text, translation of everything you see clear? What do you feel should be changed to make things easier for you?***



I like how it is now. Note that Windows 11 has some issues with a particular Ol chiki character. Because of this all websites display the character in an unexpected manner. Many users might mistake this as an issue of a platform like Common Voice.













**4. Project launching**

*Questions related to the launching of the project would be included in this section.*



***4.1 How did you prepare to launch this project?***



There was no Public Domain licensed sentences available in Santali. I started a GitHub repo. Two other friends Aryan and Ashwani, and myself managed to gather 2,000 sentences in the beginning. I have created 4,000 more sentences and that is how we created a corpus of 6,000 sentences in total. I wish Mozilla changes the requirement from Public Domain to CC-BY CC-BY-SA Licenses so that we can bring content from projects like Wikipedia and Vikaspedia.



An alternative could have been going to universities and requesting professors to engage students and contribute. With our limited time we could not go that far.



**5. Privacy**

*This section covers any privacy and ethics related questions.*



***5.1 Are there any barriers relating to the personal privacy or ethical practices?***



People are afraid of privacy risks. They fear if their voice data can be  misused. I have tried to explain to people but there is low awareness among people.



**6. Diversity**

*Questions related to different forms of diversity such as gender and accents.*



***6.1 What is the current gender distribution of contributors?***



All contributors are male at the moment.



***6.2 Are there any plans to grow gender diversity?***



We would frame a guidelines as the community grows but we are only a handful of contributors at the moment. I am making a video tutorial to help new contributors while reaching out to potential contributors. 



***6.3 How are you addressing accent diversity?***



There was a question from Mozilla but I could not respond as there are no official or standard names for different Santali accents. I think questions related to accents should allow us to provide details and contexts.



***6.4 Are you facing other issues related to language?***



As ours is an indigenous language that is written in multiple writing systems, there is always a challenge with speakers living in different places and writing with different writing systems. There is always a debate what the default writing system would be. Many other indigenous languages with writing systems have the same issue. Community-level discussions (on Discord in the context of Common Voice) and a consensus is required in such cases.
